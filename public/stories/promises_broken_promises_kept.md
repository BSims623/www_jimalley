# PROMISES BROKEN, PROMISES KEPT

Dan’s grandmother was the most important person in his life. After his father left and his mother turned to drugs, she took him in, loved him, and provided a stable, happy upbringing. She was a strong, positive role model. When he got older, he promised her he would never let anything bad happen to her.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week before Halloween, she stood on a chair on her front porch cleaning cobwebs from the eaves when, as she described it, a large bird, maybe a bat, swooped toward her and knocked her off balance, causing her to fall and break an ankle. The doctors repaired the break and planned to keep her in the hospital for three or four days until the swelling went down. For two days, the recovery went as planned. But when Dan visited on the third day, she was ashen, in restraints, and comatose. He shook her arm and called her name but she was unresponsive. And there was something else odd: on her neck were two puncture wounds, red and swollen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the nurses’ station. A short, stout nurse with a red, puffy face was studying a monitor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Excuse me. My grandmother, Mrs. Hobbs, in room 318 is in restraints and appears sedated. Can you tell me what’s going on?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctantly she turned from the monitor. “Mrs. Hobbs? Last night she became very agitated and combative. She was hitting the nurse and insisted she had to leave the hospital. We had no choice but to restrain her.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan was shocked. “But she was fine yesterday.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nurse spoke nonchalantly. “She may be having an adverse reaction to the pain medication.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can we take her off that medication?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded. “We’ve made a request to Dr. Sharma. We’re waiting for a different prescription.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And she has two puncture wounds on her neck. Have you seen those?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nurse looked up. “Puncture wounds?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She followed Dan to his grandmother’s room and assessed the affected area.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hmm. I’m not sure what those are. She may have injured herself during her rampage last night. I’ll let her doctor know.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan stayed for a while, then returned at ten o’clock that night. This time his grandmother was wide awake but quite agitated, wrestling with her restraints. Upon seeing him, she calmed down and stared at him with dead eyes. It unnerved him. This was not his usually upbeat grandmother. This was a different person.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hi Danny,” she said, her voice other-worldly, a hollow, eerie monotone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously a second voice said, “Hi Danny.” It was from the next bed, an ancient, gaunt woman, also in restraints, also in the eerie monotone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked to the neighbor and back to his grandmother. “Gramma, are you okay?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a pause, as if she were choosing her words carefully. “I’m okay.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why are you in restraints?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shrugged.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I came in this afternoon and couldn’t wake you.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I was tired. I slept soundly today.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you on a strong pain medication?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No. I was very tired. So was Mrs. Hafu.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared dumbly. “Mrs. Hafu?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded to the next bed. “My roommate.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed the subject. “Gramma, what are those marks on your neck? They look like bites, and they look infected.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still in the monotone, “I don’t know, Danny. Maybe spider bites.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They don’t look good, Gramma. Do they hurt?” He rubbed the sores with his finger. They were hard and crusted. She flinched violently, her eyes blazing, and tried to grab his wrist, but was held back by the restraints.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t touch that, Danny! It needs to heal. You mustn’t touch it.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped back, perplexed. How had his grandmother transformed from a robust, easy-going senior citizen to a demented zombie overnight? And what were those puncture wounds?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gramma spoke. “Have you seen Robin?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her. “Robin? My wife Robin?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Gramma, Robin and I are getting divorced. Remember?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She wants to see you.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He played along. “How do you know that?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She told me.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You talked to Robin?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, Danny. She comes every night to visit.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the next bed Mrs. Hafu spoke. “Every night.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt an adrenaline rush. Yes, he’d left Robin a message telling about Gramma’s injury, but didn’t expect her to visit. Since the separation, they’d drifted far apart and ceased all communication. He was sure his grandmother was hallucinating.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He headed for the nurses’ station but was intercepted in the hallway.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Danny?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman was waving from down the hall. He did a double take. It was Robin, the last person he expected to see. And something was different about her. She’d filled out a bit, her skin was whiter, her eyes a deeper blue and piercing, and she was generally more beautiful than he remembered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divorce had been his fault. He cheated, she forgave him, he cheated again, she filed for divorce. She was devastated by the betrayal and made a bitter promise to take him for every penny he was worth and destroy his life the way he’d destroyed hers. He took her seriously. He knew it was not good to be on Robin’s bad side. For six months her attorney had indeed been peppering away at his limited financial holdings, though she’d apparently thought better on her vow to destroy his life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She extended her hand and smiled warmly. “I’ve been hoping to run into you, Danny. I’ve been visiting Gramma every night and expected to see you sooner or later.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took her hand. He was amazed how good she looked, her dark hair neatly manicured, her skin so clear, and there was an easy casual air about her not there before. “Thank you for coming.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She held onto his hand. “Danny, you and I have had our disagreements, but I’ve got no argument with Gramma. She means as much to me as she does to you.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Was this the same woman he was married to for five years?_
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stepped into Gramma’s room. Gramma eyed them quietly as they approached.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin said, “Gramma, how are you feeling?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Okay,” she said in the monotone, staring straight ahead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why the restraints?” Robin asked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The nurse said she’s been combative, that it might be a reaction to the pain medication.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin assessed the wounds on Gramma’s neck. “That doesn’t look good. How long have those bites been there?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I saw them for the first time today.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin whispered to Dan, “Why is she talking so strangely?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrugged.
Robin watched Gramma as she spoke to Dan. “Sometimes when older people are in the hospital, their biorhythms get thrown off and they get disoriented. It happened to my father. Maybe that’s what’s happening to her.”

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan hoped she was right but in his gut knew it was more serious than that.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stepped into the hall to speak privately.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Danny, I don’t like the way she looks. She’s so pale and acting so weird. And those bites look terrible.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was comforted that at least someone else was on his side. “I tried to tell the nurse but she wasn’t very concerned.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Keep on them, Danny. A patient gets better treatment if they know someone’s watching. I’ll stay here all night so you can get your rest. I’ll let you know if there’s anything to report.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was genuinely moved. Robin owed him nothing at this point and her generosity meant a lot right now. “Thank you. You don’t know how much I appreciate this.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took his arm. “Actually, I’m glad I can be helpful. I feel bad about all the ugliness of the divorce. I didn’t want my attorney to go after you so hard but he insists on playing hard ball.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan shrugged. “You can always call him off.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled. “Actually, I already have.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked her in the eye. “You have? Do we need to talk?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused. “Yeah, I think we do. Not here and now, but soon.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, Gramma’s condition was no better, still disoriented, combative, and, her nurse explained, now anemic and dehydrated. And the puncture wounds looked worse. Dan stayed with her until ten o’clock when Robin showed up.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they sat with their patient, Robin said, “Danny, have you noticed anything odd about this hospital? Last night around three a.m. when it was really quiet I peeked into several other rooms along the hall. I saw at least ten elderly patients in restraints. It was the middle of the night but they were all wide awake and just stared at me with that strange look on their faces like Gramma. And Danny, they all had puncture wounds on their necks.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He digested this. “Shit, it sounds like there’s a vampire on the loose.” He was only half joking.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She watched his face. “If I didn’t know better . . . .”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Dan had a sit-down with Dr. Sharma. He asked about his grandmother’s odd behavior and the bites on her neck. The doctor listened quietly, then leafed through a stack of papers. He said Mrs. Hobbs was anemic and dehydrated, which was a mystery because her IV fluids and nutritional intake should have been sufficient to offset both anemia and dehydration.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Was she experiencing weakness or fatigue before the injury?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan shook his head. “She was healthy as a horse. All the sickness has come on since she got here.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Sharma proposed blood tests, x-rays, and continued IV therapy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But you have no idea what’s wrong with her?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Sharma assessed Dan calmly with his large brown eyes the way he had assessed a million concerned relatives before.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maybe we’ll know more after the tests.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And the puncture wounds?” he pressed. “They’re not healing. They look like fang marks from a vampire.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor remained somber. “That at least would explain the anemia and dehydration.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan looked at him incredulously. “_Seriously?_”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor closed his eyes and spoke barely above a whisper. “No.”

\#

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night as Dan sat next to Gramma listening to her rhythmic breathing, she and Mrs. Hafu spontaneously began chanting in unison.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“All the children of the master will meet as one and live for all eternity.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was silent for several beats, then, on cue, they repeated the chant. Then he heard the same chant from across the hall, then from down the hallway. The hair on the back of his neck stood up.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his grandmother turned and looked him in the eye. “Robin is coming. She wants to see you.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second later Robin stepped into the room.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How’s the patient?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan was rattled. “She’s getting weirder and weirder. She’s scaring me.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin assessed Gramma. “Danny, I’m convinced something’s going on in this hospital. Last night there were six more patients with bites on their necks. That’s sixteen in all. We’ve got to get Gramma out of here.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin was right. The next day, Dan sat in a small office with the patient ombudsman, a mousy nun in a black habit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’d like to have my grandmother transferred to another hospital.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She listened somberly as he detailed his grandmother’s symptoms, the staff’s failure to take them seriously, and his suspicion that other patients were being attacked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun’s eyes flickered. “Is this your grandmother’s decision or yours?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mine. My grandmother is too out of it to know what’s going on.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun looked him in the eye. “Do you have a power of attorney?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was flustered. “Well, no.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She assessed him evenly. “If you don’t have power of attorney and she’s unable to speak for herself, we’ll have to do a special evaluation.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And how long will that take?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked into the air. “It could take two or three days, maybe longer.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan assessed her angrily. “That’s not acceptable.”

\#

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Halloween night and there was a full moon. Dan was in bed, exhausted. The thought that his innocent grandmother was being feasted on by some kind of real-life vampire while everyone pretended it wasn’t happening weighed heavily on him. But he was relieved that it would be over soon. He and Robin had a plan. In a few hours, they would whisk Gramma out the hospital’s back door before anyone noticed. He was grateful not only that Gramma would be safe but that he and Robin would accomplish the rescue together, like family.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight his phone chirped. In the darkness he blinked at the display. It was Robin.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spoke in a hoarse whisper. “Dan, I’m scared.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What’s wrong?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Things are getting weird here. Whoever’s been attacking the patients has started in on the staff. All the nurses are acting really bizarre. They’re talking with that weird monotone and their eyes are all glazed.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you safe?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t know. I’ve got the lights off in here but I’m frightened.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Okay. Just lay low and stay quiet. I’ll be there in ten minutes.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drove like a bat out of hell, then in the darkness hurried through the parking lot into the labyrinth he’d recently come to know so well, through the same corridor, up the same elevator, turned right at the same hallway to Gramma’s ward. As his footsteps echoed through the abandoned spaces, he wondered if he was about to be attacked by a vampire at any moment.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Gramma’s ward a janitor with a pail and mop stared at him with hollow eyes. Dan nodded but the man just stared blankly. At the nurses’ station, three nurses stood silently watching him, then one spoke.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Excuse me? Can I help you?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan kept walking. “No, thank you.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sir, visiting hours are over. You’ll have to leave.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ignored her and moved briskly to Gramma’s door. The room was dark, the only light coming from the various medical apparatus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Robin?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I’m here.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She emerged from a corner as Gramma and Mrs. Hafu spoke in unison. “Hi Danny.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately there was shuffling in the hallway. Two men in blue scrubs appeared at the door. One said, “Sir, you’ll have to come with us.” Dan saw their blank expressions, dead eyes, and the fresh puncture wounds on their necks.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can’t do that,” he said and stepped backwards. The closest one stepped forward and grabbed his arm. Dan wrenched away and backed further into the room, then put his shoulders down and plowed into them. Taken by surprise, they went down like bowling pins. He turned to Robin. “C’mon!”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They tried to jump over the two, but one was able to clutch Robin’s leg and pull her down. Dan yanked on her arm. After a brief tug-of-war, he won the struggle; he and Robin got to their feet and ran off past the nurses’ station where the same nurses watched with vacant eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bend in the corridor, two more men in scrubs yelled “Stop!” and moved toward them. They headed off into another corridor. With footsteps pursuing them, they found an elevator going down and jumped in as the doors were closing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went down one floor, ran to the opposite end of the building, took another elevator back to Gramma’s floor and snuck back to her room. They expected to find opposition but amazingly saw no one. Quickly they unfastened Gramma’s restraints and Dan scooped her out of bed and into a wheelchair. Hastily they pushed her into the hallway and went the opposite direction from the nurses’ station to a back elevator and pushed the ground floor button. As they waited, they were sure someone would approach but no one did.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground floor they stepped cautiously into the corridor. Off in the distance they saw more dead-eyed staff in scrubs. They moved silently in the opposite direction and around a corner out of sight. Pushing Gramma’s wheelchair, they twisted and turned through the hospital’s maze of corridors. After an eternity they found the entrance, passed through the front double doors and jostled the wheelchair into the darkness. They hurried through the parking lot to Dan’s car, placed Gramma in the back seat and drove away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gramma was miraculously reserved through all this, now sitting quietly with her large, vacant eyes wide open.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin said, “Where are we going?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan said, “I don’t know,” then drove around randomly for a while until he was sure they weren’t being followed, then to Gramma’s house.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted Gramma out of the car and carried her inside. They walked to the back of the house, leaving all the lights off, retreating to the guest bedroom. There Dan eased Gramma into a chair and he and Robin sat on the bed. All was calm and quiet. At last, they felt safe. Their breathing slowed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan wondered what to do next: Call the police, tell them vampires were chasing them?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minutes passed, then half an hour. Despite the circumstances, Dan was enjoying being here in a quiet room with Gramma and Robin. It was like old times. And though it was irrational, he suddenly felt a strong attraction to Robin. Obviously this was not the time or place, but reflexively he touched her shoulder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled back sharply and gazed at him with sad eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t do that, Danny.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m sorry.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief lull, she said, “When we were married, I was so happy. I hoped we would stay together forever.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head guiltily. “Believe it or not, Robin, so did I.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face turned dark. “When you cheated on me, you destroyed all that.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart sank. “I know, but it’s not too late, is it?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the dim light he could see the hate in her eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a growing uneasiness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Robin, I’m so sorry. I don’t know what possessed me.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grabbed his jaw in a superhuman clench and jerked his face toward hers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You destroyed my life!”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gramma spoke.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You destroyed her life.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But Robin, your life’s not destroyed. You’re a beautiful woman. You’ve got everything to live for. We could start back up and everything would be the way it was before. I would never cheat on you again. Believe me,I’ve learned my lesson.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She yanked him harshly so they were eye to eye.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Danny, after we separated, I found someone else, a man named Drago. We lived together. Only after it was too late did I learn he was a vampire. And now I’m a vampire.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gramma said, _“She’s a vampire.”_ Dan’s throat tightened and a shiver ran up his back. He would have thought Robin was joking were her voice not so full of rage, her eyes so dark, her clutch on him so superhumanly strong. This was definitely no joke. He swallowed hard.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’re the one who bit Gramma?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And the others in the hospital?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But why?”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled him closer. Her face was an ugly snarl. “To destroy your life, Danny, the way you destroyed mine.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gramma echoed, _“To destroy your life, Danny.”_
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he could react, she slid around and pressed her face against his neck. Briefly he enjoyed this intimacy, then felt the sharp needle prick.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to pull away but was powerless, tried to speak but was mute as he felt the strength draining from his body.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was done with him, she let him collapse to the floor. He gazed up to her with glassy eyes. He wanted to speak, wanted to ask questions, wanted to apologize, but could not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wiped her mouth, then looked down at him. “I made you a promise, Danny. Unlike you, I kept my promise. Now you can rot in hell.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gramma said, _“You can rot in hell, Danny.”_
